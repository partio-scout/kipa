Kipa windows installer

Setup :
1. Copy the Apache installer to root dir. (where this README is located)
2. Modify install.cfg so that the filename and keys apply to the Apache to be installed. (registry key version number)
3. Copy python that has reportlab and mod_python addon suitable for the specific apache under dir "python".
4. Copy Apache addons under dir "Apache"
5. Copy Kipa source under web

6. Run setup.exe and confirm that kipa installs and works.
7. Create self extracting package that runs setup.exe automatically. Use some nice free sofware like ChilkatZipSE.

8. Release the file.
